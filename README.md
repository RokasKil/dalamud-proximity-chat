# Proximity Chat

A quickly made dalamud plugin that will probably be never used. Allows you to convert chosen chat channels into proximity based ones like say chat. It is achieved by hiding messages on the client side, so players without this plugin will still be able to see them.

Idea is to use it instead of say chat so you don't get banned for public banter between friends.
